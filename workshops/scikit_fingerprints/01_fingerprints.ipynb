   "source": [
    "Molecular fingerprints are the basic way of turning molecules into feature vectors for ML. We can divide them roughly into 4 types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Descriptors** - predefined sets of real numbers, e.g. molecular mass, logP, elements distribution. Examples include [RDKit 2D descriptors](https://scikit-fingerprints.readthedocs.io/latest/modules/generated/skfp.fingerprints.RDKit2DDescriptorsFingerprint.html), [Mordred](https://scikit-fingerprints.readthedocs.io/latest/modules/generated/skfp.fingerprints.MordredFingerprint.html), and [VSA](https://scikit-fingerprints.readthedocs.io/latest/modules/generated/skfp.fingerprints.VSAFingerprint.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Substructural fingerprints** - predefined set of substructures to detect, e.g. elements, functional groups, rings. Defined as a list of SMARTS patterns, typically created by expert chemists. Examples include [MACCS](https://scikit-fingerprints.readthedocs.io/latest/modules/generated/skfp.fingerprints.MACCSFingerprint.html), [Klekota-Roth](https://scikit-fingerprints.readthedocs.io/latest/modules/generated/skfp.fingerprints.KlekotaRothFingerprint.html), and [Laggner](https://scikit-fingerprints.readthedocs.io/latest/modules/generated/skfp.fingerprints.LaggnerFingerprint.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hashed fingerprints** - most algorithmic in nature. Each one defines a particular subgraph shape, e.g. circular neighborhoods, the shortest paths between pairs of atoms, or short walks. All such subgraphs are extracted for a molecule, assigned integer identifiers, and hashed into the output feature vector. Examples include [ECFP (Morgan)](https://scikit-fingerprints.readthedocs.io/latest/modules/generated/skfp.fingerprints.ECFPFingerprint.html), [Atom Pair](https://scikit-fingerprints.readthedocs.io/latest/modules/generated/skfp.fingerprints.AtomPairFingerprint.html), and [RDKit fingerprint](https://scikit-fingerprints.readthedocs.io/latest/modules/generated/skfp.fingerprints.RDKitFingerprint.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Other** - some fingerprints are pretty hard to assign into one of those above categories, mostly those based on 3D conformations. They are often histograms or other statistics of interatomic distances with various weighting schemes (e.g., partial charge). Examples include [USR](https://scikit-fingerprints.readthedocs.io/latest/modules/generated/skfp.fingerprints.USRFingerprint.html), [Autocorrelation](https://scikit-fingerprints.readthedocs.io/latest/modules/generated/skfp.fingerprints.AutocorrFingerprint.html), and [MoRSE](https://scikit-fingerprints.readthedocs.io/latest/modules/generated/skfp.fingerprints.MORSEFingerprint.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "RDKit has:\n",
    "- a few descriptors available, but not as classes and in various places (e.g. RDKit 2D descriptors, VSA)\n",
    "- 1 substructural fingerprint (MACCS)\n",
    "- 10 hashed fingerprints (Atom Pair, Avalon, ECFP, ErG, Layered, MHFP, Pattern, RDKit, SECFP, Topological Torsion)\n",
    "- a few other fingerprints (some as functions, other as classes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the biggest practical problem is that all of the above have very varied interfaces and modules - they need to be imported from 9 places!\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-fingerprints currently has 35 fingerprints, all with unified scikit-learn interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example with ECFP fingerprint, which has a generator interface in RDKit, a very nice API."
